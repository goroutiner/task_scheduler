### 🔧 Environment Configuration

The **environment** variables are set by default, but you can change them in the `compose.yaml` file:

- For the `golang` service:

```yaml
...
environment:
    PORT: ":7540"
    MODE: "postgres"
    DATABASE_URL: "postgres://root:password@postgres:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable"
    PASSWORD: "qwerty12345678"
...
```

If you need **SQLite** mode, specify `MODE: "sqlite"`.

- For the `postgres` service:

```yaml
...
environment:
  POSTGRES_USER: "root"
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "password"
  POSTGRES_DB: "mydb"
...
```
